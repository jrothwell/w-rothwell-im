<p>I am <strong><a href="http://www.rothwell.im/about/">Jonathan Rothwell</a></strong>, Computer Science student by day and occasional writer by night.</p>

<p>Sometimes I write short stories for fun and put them up here for your enjoyment. Currently I'm aiming to write one new story every week to be posted on Friday or Saturday.</p>
