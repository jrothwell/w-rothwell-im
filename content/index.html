<p>I am <strong><a href="http://www.rothwell.im/about/">Jonathan Rothwell</a></strong>, computer programmer by day and occasional writer by night.</p>

<p>Sometimes I write short stories for fun and put them up here for your enjoyment. Currently I'm aiming to write one new story every week or two: I'll post an update on <a href="http://rothwell.im">my blog</a> when a new one gets posted.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/stories/">There are <%= stories.count %> stories on this site totalling <%= word_count_of_all_stories %> words. Full list&nbsp;&rarr;</a></strong></p>

<hr />

<% newest_story = @site.sorted_stories.first %>

<h2>Newest story: <%= link_to(newest_story[:title], newest_story) %></h2>
<p><span class="metadata">(posted <%= newest_story[:date] %>)</span>&nbsp;<%= newest_story[:desc] %> <em><%= round_nearest(100, word_count_of_story(newest_story)) %> words</em> <%= link_to('Read&nbsp;&rarr;', newest_story, :class => "readme") %></p>
